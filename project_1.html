                  In this era of globalization, the English language has become one of the most important skills of the world. Learning English has become a top priority, all kinds of training classes and APP has widely occurred one after another.
                  <br><br>Shanbay News APP arises at the historic moment, from reading original English news began to allow you to learn English well.This app was first put online in 2013, after years’ development, it sure makes great success in this field, but there are still several comments and experience to be satisfied.

                <p>
                  Since there was no budget for a comprehensive user survey, I mainly refer to the comments on the APP Store. As can be concluded from the reviews on app store, Two main questions occurred currently.

              <ul style="margin-left: -20;">
                <li>
                  What is the user group and what the age ranges in? Clearly, human have different values and appreciation of the beauty at different age. when choosing an app, we check its icon, its  experiment and its practicality.
                </li>
                <li>
                  What is the core requirement? Those who use this app may want to improve their reading skills, create the atmosphere about learning English or start to learn English from the beginning. different targets cause different needs and it’s certainly hard to meet everyone’s need.

                  Transfer it into ‘mine’ for too complicated hierarchy putting on the homepage. We don’t delete it because as an app designed for learning English, review is really important. this revise system is designed to put at ‘mine’, and change its name to ‘my reading record’.

                  The former one only contains three module ‘shanbay news’ ‘already read the whole passage’ ‘read but not finish reading’. Now I put the reading setting in the menu, to satisfy the core requirement. users use shanbei to learn English, they focus more on the difficulty level and the resource. so i delete the formal drop-down menu while saving the topbar, hided a grey hierarchy to hint the user that they can find what they want at this striking position.

                  Meanwhile, I add a new part in the homepage to replace the head figure, which is only the picture of the first article,looking seemingly useless and taking large space. I name this part as featured news. this is a new design based on the cloud computing and the big date. By calculating users’ completely read articles, we can filtrate news ,which accord with users’ reading ability and interest, put them on the front page.

                  The meaning of color lump is to attract people, using color lump at the left side, taking large space of the screen can strike the eye. As level and resource are two significant elements during learning English, using color lump to highlight them offers convenience for users to choose the essay.

                  From the vision theory, shadow can focalize users’ thought, abandon distraction from other elements. Unfolding the drop-down shadows everything, shadow everything expect the menu to indicate that only the menu can click on, or click on the shadow to quit.

                  These three functions are referred to as a reward system, when finishing the task on time, users can clock on app, schedule can give users a full view about their clock situation, also reading plan stimulates users to finish task day by day. After all, checking the schedule and the reading plan to see users’ own pace is a good selection.The Collins dictionary, shanbay’s marketing product and profit source, ought to be set at the sidebar. also, It’s a good tool for learning English.

                  It is the weaken set type, so that users won’t mix them with the button above. Different layout can also emphasize the frequently used setting, which I mean the ‘quit’ and the ‘night mode’. quickly turn-off light button and an easily quit button is very humanization.

                  It was set at the sidebar before, but as it is called ‘my’ collection, rearranging it to mine is a better choice as it conforms the thinking logic of human being.

                  it’s a new design based on the formal drop-down menu. At first I want to delete it because it seems useless, but later I found it’s meaning. shanbay news, as an English-learning product instead of a news app, should pay attention to the review. The formal menu can indeed be the review system so I choose to save it .but it’s not that important that should be put on the front page,so I moved it here.

                  The main body of an essay means the most colorful part. at this part, I focus on the reading experience. I design to add a new button at the top right corner to hide or display the imaginary line.

                  Too much imaginary line affects the reading experience. To give the users a better reading experience, I design a new button to hide the line. Meanwhile, users can also display the line to study new words.

                  The last part is the community. It maintains 5 parts before to make communication or propagation, I move one thing called ’shanbay class’ to the community, whose original name is ‘class setting’, set in the ‘setting’ and plays a less important role that few users will use it.

                  Moving class to community matches the concept of ‘community’, where we communicate and learn from someone;Put off the weight of the sidebar;Shanbay class, whose original name is ‘class setting’. It’s reasonable to put in the ‘setting’. However I change it into a new name and give it the new property,which is to adapt the future business of the company,

                After the whole frame, some controversies occur in my mind. <br>
                Is it really necessary to put a ‘setting’ button?<br>
                usually, almost all the apps contain the ‘setting’ button, which includes all the function setting. In some degree, it is qualified for users’ potential consciousness to induce and classify the functions, but it is inevasible that this will cause the second stage catalog, increasing the degree of complexity indirectly when using. Meanwhile, after searching all the other products made by shanbay, I find that most ‘setting ’ botton can or should be placed at a more conspicuous and important position. As a result, I make up my mind to delete the ‘setting’ button and rearrange the containing.

                I wonder what’s the true meaning of the drop-out menu, which maintains ‘shanbay news’, ‘already read article’ and ‘read article’. I am curious about the formal design thought. At first, I believe it is useless and I want to delete it. But soon it occurs to me that it might be a revise system as revising accounts for the main part in learning English. but I’m still not sure whether I make a correction or make a wrong move.

                As an old saying goes,There are a thousand Hamlets in a thousand people's eyes. Every function and every layout has its advantage as well as disadvantage, maybe the disadvantage you think is the shining point in some other designers’ eyes. We are supposed to think about every detail and every meaning behind the user experience.
